THE COCK.

[Illustration]

  The _Cock_ doth crow to let you know,
  If you be wise, what time to rise.


There is no bird treated with so much cruelty as the _Cock_; for he,
poor thing, (without the least offence,) is tied to a stake, and
thrown at by a set of idle, wicked, barbarous fellows, till he is
beaten in pieces. This is a custom the very heathens would blush at;
and therefore I hope you, who are a christian, will never be guilty of
any thing so inhuman.

[Illustration]




THE PARROT.

[Illustration]

  The _Parrot_ prates he knows not what,
  For all he says is got by rote.


The _Parrot_ is a chattering bird, he talks a great deal, yet knows not
what he says; and is therefore not unlike some silly boys, who prate
without thinking, and learn their lesson without looking at their book.




THE CUCKOW.

[Illustration]

  The _Cuckow_ tells a merry tale,
  Upon the hill and in the vale.


There’s the pretty _Cuckow_! This good-natured bird comes a long
journey once every year to see all his friends, and sing them a song.
And after he has obliged them with his company about three months, he
takes his leave, and returns to his own country again.




THE COW.

[Illustration]

  Early the _milkmaid_ to the meadow hies,
  And the _red Cow_ her empty pail supplies.


This is the good-natured _Cow_ to which we are all so much obliged. She
comes, poor thing! in the morning, and brings her udder full of milk
for our breakfast, and the same at night for our supper. To her we are
indebted for our custards, cheesecakes, curds and cream, as well as for
our milk, butter, and cheese.

[Illustration]




THE NIGHTINGALE.

[Illustration]

  The _Nightingale_ doth sweetly sing,
  To welcome in the cheerful spring.


What a pretty bird the _Nightingale_ is! How sweetly she sings! I could
wish ’twas summer all the year for the sake of her good company.




THE LAMB.

[Illustration]

  The little _Lamb_ doth skip and play,
  Always merry, always gay.


See the little _Lamb_! how innocent he looks! he never did any harm,
and therefore is beloved by every body: but the fox and the wolf, who
are always in mischief, are hated and despised.




THE LION.

[Illustration]

  The _Lion_ ranges round the wood,
  And makes the lesser beasts his food:
  Thus tyrants on their subjects prey,
  And rule with arbitrary sway.


Though the _Lion_ is such a strong devouring creature, yet _Daniel_ was
thrown into a den among several of them, and received no harm. For he
was punished on account of his religion and virtue, he prayed unto God,
and the Lord delivered him.

[Illustration]




THE WHALE.

[Illustration]

  The _Whale’s_ the monarch of the main,
  (As is the lion of the plain):
  He keeps the lesser fish in awe,
  And, tyrant-like, his will’s his law.


When the prophet _Jonah_ attempted to fly over sea from the presence of
the Lord there arose a great storm, and he being cast into the deep,
was swallowed by this great fish, in whose belly he repented sincerely,
and prayed unto God; wherefore the Lord commanded the fish, and he swam
to shore, and cast him upon dry land.

[Illustration]




THE BUTTERFLY.

[Illustration]

  The _Butterfly_ in gaudy dress,
  The worthless coxcomb doth express,
  Who not regarding whence he rose,
  Is proud of what?--of his fine clothes.


This gaudy _Butterfly_ owes its being to a poor worm, and has nothing
to boast of but his fine wings, which perhaps will be lost the first
frosty day: and then his case will be much like the coxcomb’s, who
having lost his fine hat and bag wig, has nothing to support him but a
head full of emptiness.

[Illustration]




THE CROCODILE.

[Illustration]

  The _Crocodile_, with watery eyes,
  O’er man and every creature cries,
  Then feeds with pleasure on his prey;
  So hypocrites their friends betray.


This terrible creature is said to weep over his prey before he devours
it, as if he was unwilling to destroy any thing; but in truth, that
whining is only to bring other creatures to see what’s the matter,
that Mr. _Crocodile_ may get another snap for his belly.

[Illustration]




THE ASS.

[Illustration]

  The _Ass_, tho’ mean, will by his bray
  Oblige your _horse_ to run away.


Though this animal makes such a mean figure, yet _Sampson_, with the
jawbone of an _Ass_, slew a thousand men. But then the Lord was with
him, and God Almighty can do any thing.




THE ANT.

[Illustration]

  The little _Ant_ no labour spares,
  Wisely preventing future cares;
  For ere the hoary frost comes on,
  Her stock’s laid up, and business done.


This little creature was a great favourite with the wise king
_Solomon_, who much admired her industry and carefulness, and
recommends her to the consideration of every idle person.

‘Arise thou sluggard, go to the _Ant_, consider her ways, and be wise.’

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
